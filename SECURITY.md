# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**DO NOT CREATE AN ISSUE** to report a security problem. Instead, please send an email to security@fintechless.com

## Incident Response Process

In case an incident is discovered or reported, we will follow the following process to contain, respond and remediate:

### Contain

The first step is to find out the root cause, nature and scope of the incident.
* Is still ongoing? If yes, first priority is to stop it.
* Is the incident outside of our influence? If yes, first priority is to contain it.
* Find out who knows about the incident and who is affected.
* Find out what data was potentially exposed.

### Respond

After the initial assessment and containment to our best abilities, we will document all actions taken in a response plan.

We will create a new release with comments to inform users about the incident and what actions were taken to contain it.

### Remediate

Once the incident is confirmed to be resolved, we will summarize the lessons learned from the incident and create a list of actions we will take to prevent it from happening again.


## Vulnerability Management Plan

### Keep permissions to a minimum

The Fintechless.com uses the least amount of access to limit the impact of possible security incidents, see Information collection and use.

If someone would get access to the WIP app, the worst thing they could do is to read out contents from pull requests, limited to repositories the WIP got installed on.

### Secure accounts with access

The [Fintechless Organization](https://github.com/fintechless) on GitHub requires 2FA authorization for all members.

### Critical Updates and Security Notices

We learn about critical software updates and security threats from these sources:
* [GitHub Security Alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-security-vulnerabilities/about-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies)
* [Snyk's Vulnerability DB](https://snyk.io/vuln)
* [Node.js Security Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg)
